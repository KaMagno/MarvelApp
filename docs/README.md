# Marvel App
## developed by Kaique Magno

I Created this app as a recruting development challenge and now It changed to an App which I use to show about my development knowledge and how I code. 

Here are some technologies I am using:
- Architecture
  - VIPER
- Framework management
  - Carthage
- Other Things
  - Async requests
  - Async Image loading
  - CoreData with Codable protocols
  - Pagination on CollectionView
  - TabBar
  - ... 

To help me to apply everything I think of about this app I start a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/pTAKHJqE/marvel-app) to try organize myself which I would be happy to have suggestions that you can do in the issues tab.

This GitHub Page and Project is in development so It will be changing frequently.

Thanks to read and be interest to this project.
