# Marvel App
## by Kaique Magno

I created this App as a recruting development challenge and after many others challenges I decided to use this project as a demonstration of my development skills.

### Technologies and patterns
- Architecture
  - VIPER

- Framework management
  - Carthage

- Other stuff
  - Async requests
  - Async Image loading
  - CoreData with Codable protocols
  - Pagination on CollectionView
  - TabBar
  - ... 
  
  ### To FIX 
  - [ X ] Unfavorite a Character in Characters Screen.
  - [ ] Favorite and Unfavorite a Character in Characters Detail Screen.
  - [ ] Improve cell data loading in Characters Screen.
 
 ### More
I created a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/pTAKHJqE/marvel-app) to try to organize myself with everything I would like to develop for this App.

I would be happy to have suggestions that you can do in the issues tab.

*This GitHub Page and Project is in **development** so It will be changing frequently.*

Thanks to read and be interest to this project.
